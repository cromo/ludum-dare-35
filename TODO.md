# Todo
## Basics

- [x] State machine/events system
  - [ ] choice states may be broken
- [x] Asset loading
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] Tiles/level design
- [ ] Graphics
- [x] Config file for things like run mode (debug/release)

## Events and state machines

- [ ] add the collider to the collision event
- [ ] walking -> jumping when no longer colliding with floor
- [ ] add sensors around the player

## Graphics

- [x] camera

## When making levels

- [ ] all level objects should be collidable
- [ ] the player start should not be collidable
- [ ] the level end shoud be collidable and a sensor
- [ ] all collision edges should have a facing property

## Shapes / Player States

- [ ] Ball
- [ ] Spikes (floor/ceiling/walls)
- [ ] Springs
- [ ] Compressed
- [ ] Stretched
- [ ] Boat
- [ ] Umbrella
- [ ] Bike
- [ ] Taco
- [ ] Enemy

## Levels

- [ ] walking
- [ ] walls and jumping
- [ ] pit of death
- [ ] *shift* and climbable wall
- [ ] jump across death and shift to grab mid-jump
- [ ] double shift, wall climb
- [ ] double shift, mandatory back and forth climb
